\chapter{Background}
This chapter is going to introduce concepts that may be unknown to the reader but central to the project. This chapter is purely theoretical, and no new information will be presented here. The subjects comprising this chapter include:
\begin{itemize}
\item An introduction to the reversible programming paradigm (Section \ref{Reverse}), as well as the language used in this project (Section \ref{Hermes}).
\item An overview of the two public-key cryptosystems that will be attempted implemented (Section \ref{Async}).
\item Some theory on Galois fields and arithmetic functions therein (Section \ref{Galois}).
\end{itemize}
The math for both RSA and Elliptic Curves is mostly based on the corresponding chapters in \cite{IntroToMath}, while Galois field theory comes from \cite{FiniteFieldArithmetic}.
