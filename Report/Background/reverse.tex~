\section{Reversible programming}

\subsection{Why reversibility?}
This might be the first section of the report, so a basic introduction of the pros of reversible programming.

\subsection{Hermes}
An introduction to Hermes, and what is special about it, specifically with relation to cryptography.

\subsection{Cryptography in a reversible manner}
Nothing new here. Present some previous worrk on Hermes, and explain why cryptography has a particularly neat nature when it comes to reversibility. Asynchronous cryptography to come later.
