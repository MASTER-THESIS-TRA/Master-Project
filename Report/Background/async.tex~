\section{Asynchronous cryptography}
Talk about some basic asynchronous cryptography principles.

\subsection{RSA}
Specifically a designated, in-depth sub-section about RSA, as this is the first algorithm that will be attempted implemented.

\subsection{Elliptic curve cryptography}
Even if not implemented, it can still be worth a mention, if nothing else, then for the sake of considering alternatives to RSA that may be subject of future work as well. %%Probably not what is meant by future work.
