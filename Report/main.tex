%%%% Efter den er skrevet, sørg lige for at trille den igennem grammarly. 
%The aim of this thesis is to explore the relationship between asymmetric cryptography algorithms and how to implement these in the reversible programming language Hermes currently being developed by DIKU. This language is specifically designed for the implementation of encryption algorithms while eliminating side-channels, and currently only symmetric algorithms have been implemented. 


%The algorithms to be implemented will consist of RSA and Elliptic Curve, both of which encompasses one-way trapdoor functions, which by nature is not
