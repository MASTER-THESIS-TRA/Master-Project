The report template contains a an overall outline of a report at the bachelor-level at DIKU. Your report might contain different chapters and sections than what is outlined below as it can be very project dependent. It does however contain the expected parts.

%%% INTRODUCTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Introduction} 
Shortly describe the project; about 1-2 pages
\begin{itemize}
  \item Set the environment/story of the project,
  \item build that into a problem leading up to the ``hypothesis''
  \item give an overview of how you have investigated this hypothesis and point to important work you have done; it can be an advantage to use references to exact sections
\end{itemize}

This chapter is intended to give the reader the information about your report and build up and expectation of what to come. You want to make the reader aware of the good things you have made, so he has something to look forward to.

Before starting with a section, a chapter should include a short description of what is to come and possible what assumptions you have made. Again we want to build up the expectation of the reader.

\chapter{Background}
Everything that is needed to understand you project that you have not made your self. Remember that the report should be written to a student on your level. Thus, material from the first couple of years can be general knowledge. Though if you some part extensively (e.g. further develop) it can be a good idea to recap. For example, if your project is to develop a better version of Dijkstra's algorithm~\cite{dijkstra1959method}, it can be a good recap it. However, if you are developing a domain specific languages, there is no need to recap lexer/parser generators~\cite{parserGenerator}, as these are used as tools.

Remember also to include all needed references.
