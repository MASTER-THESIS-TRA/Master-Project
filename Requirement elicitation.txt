Classes: 
  - Resources: 
    - Can neither be dublicated nor discarded (but should be consued upon transformation). 
    - Location
    - 
  - Events: 
    - Transfer
    - Transform
    - Transport

  - Information (is this part of the system??)
    - Probably easiest implemented as dokuments that can be uploaded and shared. 

  - Strategies
    - An option to automatically follow a strategy (pay money in accordance with a contract etc.) 
    - this seems out of scope for our system, no? 

  - Contracts

Agents:
  - Users: Can be associated with an organisation. 
  - Organisations
  - IoT devices (probably necessary for introducing new Resources. 
  - 


Possible pitfalls: 
  - Calendars: we need to look into ways of enforcing calendars (bank holidays etc). 
  - Identities: Should each object just have an identity field/username, og should identities be actual classes that can be linked to some resource og agent.
